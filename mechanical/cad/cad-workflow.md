## Onshape Workflow Standards

This section will outline stardard workflows in Onshape for Team 1675. In general, our CAD designs will follow a top-down workflow in which most parts are derived off of a master sketch or master model. This allows critical dimensions to be defined and updated in a singular location and updates will propogate through parts and assemblies.

### Top-Down Design Training
[Onshape - Top-Down Design](https://learn.onshape.com/learn/learning-path/top-down-design)

 These training modules will show the basics of the top-down design approach that the team takes before getting into the specific ways we use these techniques in our parts and assemblies.

 In these modules you will learn:
 - Multi-part Part Studios
 - Managed In-Context Design
 - Designing with Master Models

 *Recommended for: Robot Design Team; 3 Lessons 6-10 hours*
