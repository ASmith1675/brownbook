## Getting started with Onshape

### Why Onshape
Team 1675 has standardized on using Onshape as our CAD package to design robots. While this particular CAD software is not currently an industry standard, there are many advantages that it provides our team that most other CAD options are lacking.

1. Full free access for students

    Onshape provides an educational liscense free of charge for any students and teachers. This allows full access to all features with minimal overhead.

2. Low system requirements

    Onshape is a browser-based CAD solution, which means the heavy lifting of is done in the cloud. This allows us to run CAD on nearly any computer and has the additional benefit of not needing to install software to view CAD models.

3. Automatic Syncing and Version Control

    Because it is a cloud-based solution, updates made on one computer can almost instantly be seen on another, without the need for syncing or downloading files. (Think google-docs for CAD). In additional there are version control features that will allow rolling-back changes when needed.
