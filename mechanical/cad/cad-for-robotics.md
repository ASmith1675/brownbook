## Onshape Learning Resources

These links are tutorials in Onshape that will guide you through the basics of creating part studios and assemblies in onshape with specific focus on robot designs.

If you have an interest in design or CAD, it is recommended you work through these courses as additional knowledge will be built off of these foundations.

You will need to have an Onshape account and be logged in to go through this training. If you do not yet have an account, follow the guide found [here](./cad-getting-started.md)
