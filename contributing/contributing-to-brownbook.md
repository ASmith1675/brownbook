## Contributing to brownbook

As a team we put time into discussing the philosophy and processes behind brownbook. The results of these are listed on this page.

### Philosophy

#### What should brownbook be?
* A gathering of institutional knowledge gained by FRC1675 over its years of experience
* A place for new team members (or team members trying new things) to learn and take in information at their own pace
* Reference material for team standards
* Focused on efforts that will be used and maintained for the long-term (4+ years) future

#### What should brownbook not be?
* A record of team events/designs (unless presented as an example or case study)
* Attempt to completely replace new member/skill training
* Specific to a given game or season
