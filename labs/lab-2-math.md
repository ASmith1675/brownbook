# Lab 2: Basic Java math

### Definitions:

* **Operators**: Special characters recognized by Java that perform some sort of action.

### Common operators

There are five basic math operators in Java:
* **\+** \-\-\- addition
* **\-** \-\-\- subtraction
* **\*** \-\-\- multiplication
* **/** \-\-\- division
* **%** \-\-\- modulus

The first four work the same as they do in math class, for the most part. The exception is division of ints. If you use division and both numbers are ints, the result will be rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, ```9 / 5``` is 1, not 1.8.

An easy way to think of modulus is taking the remainder of division. For example, ```7 % 5``` is the remainder of ```7 / 5```, 2.
