### Definitions:

* **Functions**: a named section of a program that performs a specific task.
   * Functions often generate output when provided input, the example below computes the addition of two input numbers a and b. 
     ```
     float add(float a, floatb) {
        return a + b;
     }
     ```
   * Use functions to organize your code by grouping related code together.
   * Use functions to reduce duplication of code for operations that must be performed many times.
   * You are already familiar with functions through your experience with ```System.out.println()``` and ```Math.abs()```
