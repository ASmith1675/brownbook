### What is git and what is git used for?

Git is the stupid content tracker as dubbed by Linus Torvalds it's creator. On a more serious note, Git is something called a content tracker which is capable of cataloging all changes you make to tracked files. Git and other content trackers allow for programmers to work both individually and collaboratively through allowing both local and global changes to a codebase.

### Create a github account

You will need to create an account on github.com. Make your username something professional! You may keep this account for a long time and use it to show examples of code you've written.

### Install git

Install git on your development computer. You can get it from https://git-scm.com/ . Team laptops will have git already installed and configured the way we want.

When installing select these options:

* Use Git from Git Bash only
* Use the OpenSSL library
* Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings
* Use MinTTY

Those are the important ones to make sure, default on every other screen should be fine.

### Fork the repository

In the main page of the repository you want to work on, there will be a Fork button in the upper right. Click it.

Forking creates a personal version of the repo for you to make changes in. Once your changes are made, you will request that the main project take your changed.
